								<p>Hello, my name is Aidan Villegas and I am a 2nd year electrical engineering student at Irvine Valley College. I am passionate about technology and innovation, and I am excited to learn more about the latest developments in the field of electrical engineering. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to solve complex problems and to create innovative solutions. I believe that electrical engineering has the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and I am committed to pursuing a career in this field. I am looking forward to learning from experienced professionals and to contributing to the field of electrical engineering. By the way, check out some of my <a href="#projects">projects</a>.</p>

							<article id="projects">
								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p>As an electrical engineering student, I believe that project-based learning is one of the best ways to learn about my field. This approach allows me to apply the theories and concepts I'm learning in the classroom to real-world problems and projects. It also helps me to develop important skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and collaboration, that are essential for success in my field. I find that working on projects that have relevance to my interests and career goals is more engaging and motivating than other forms of learning. I also appreciate the opportunity to learn from my mistakes and to reflect on my learning as I progress through a project. Here is a summary of some of the projects I have embarked on: </p>
								<h2 class="minor">Automatic Dog Feeder (2021)</h2>
								<p>The project involved the design and construction of an automatic dog feeder for my dog. The feeder was designed to dispense exactly 2 cups of dog food at set intervals, providing a convenient and reliable way to feed my pet.

									To create the feeder, I purchased a housing for storing the dog food and modified it by attaching a servo motor to the turn valve of the dispenser. I then used an Arduino Uno to control the operation of the servo motor, carefully calibrating the timings to dispense the exact amount of food.
									
									One of the challenges of the project was getting the timings for the servo operation just right. I had to experiment with different durations and fine-tune the settings to ensure that the correct amount of food was dispensed each time. Another challenge was attaching the servo to the twist knob of the dispenser, as it required some mechanical ingenuity to securely mount the motor while still allowing it to operate smoothly.
									
									In the end, the project was a success, and I was able to create a fully functional automatic dog feeder that dispensed the correct amount of food at the desired intervals. The feeder has been in use for several months now, and it has proved to be a convenient and reliable way to ensure that my dog is well-fed.</p>
								<h2 class="minor">DoodleBot (2021)</h2>
								<p>DoodleBot is a simple robot that can draw basic shapes using a 3D printed skeleton, two motors with wheels, and a pen. The robot is powered by an Elegoo UNO R3 microcontroller, which enables it to move in a pre-programmed pattern based on the code that is used for its motor function. The user can input the quantity and pattern of steps for the motors, which determines the shape that the robot will draw. For example, if the user inputs a pattern of four steps forward and two steps back, the robot will move in a square pattern, drawing a square shape on the surface below.  </p>
								<h2 class="minor">NaviBot (2022)</h2>
							    <p>NaviBot is a simple robot that uses ultrasonic sensors to navigate around obstacles. The robot is partially constructed using the same 3D printed skeleton as DoodleBot, but it has no pen attached and is equipped with two mounted 40kHz ultrasonic sensors on the front. For example, when the ultrasonic sensors emit waves that bounce back, indicating the presence of an object in front of the robot, the two motors will stop and the right motor will turn NaviBot until the ultrasonic sensors no longer detect any objects. This allowed the robot to navigate around obstacles without colliding with them.</p>
								<h2 class="minor">GamingPi (2022)</h2>
							    <p>The Retro Gaming Console project is a simple and fun project that uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a NES USB controller, and an emulator software called RetroPie to create a retro gaming console. The project involves installing RetroPie on the Raspberry Pi Zero W, connecting the NES USB controller, and configuring the emulator to play classic games from the NES. Revisting the classics with this project was something I just had to try, plus it initially got me familiar with some of the Raspberry Pi's functions.</p>

								<p>Hi, my name is Aidan Villegas and I am an electrical engineering student at Irvine Valley College. I am passionate about technology and innovation, and I am always looking for ways to apply my knowledge and skills to projects. In my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in engineering principles, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as an engineer.</p>
									I am originally from Anaheim, California, and I have always been fascinated by the way that electricity and electronics can be used to power and control the world around us. After completing my high school studies, I decided to pursue a degree in electrical engineering, and I have been enjoying every moment of my studies so far. I have gained practical experience through hands-on projects, and I have developed a strong set of technical and analytical skills.</p>
									In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and exploring new technologies. I am particularly interested in robotics and A.I development, and I am always looking for ways I can utilize my skills and take on projects that can transcend my learning experience. I also enjoy mountaineering, rock climbing, and spending time with my friends and family.
									Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my work. If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to contact me via email at [atvillegas2003@gmail.com].</p>
